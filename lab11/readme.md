#Part 1:
(Do this http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Intro_IRC_Activity)
##Part 1.2
- I installed colliquy
##Part 1.3:
observations of the chosen IRC channel (either from chosen HFOSS channel or from project channel)
- People don't talk much.
- People ask very succinct questions and receive answers.
- Sometimes people go to side channel to talk.
- Although it's not open source, I think Slack (or hipchat or even email) would be a better place for development discussion. IRC seems like it used to be very useful.

#Part 2:
- observations:
  - you register a nick name via /server REGISTER <nick> <password> <email>
  - the #sourcforge channel is no longer the default channel of foss2serve
  - the foss2serve channel is their channel.
    - no one uses it
  - The general debian discussion on irc.debian.org #debian is actually very active.
  - They have 800 users.

        There are 32 users and 10978 invisible on 18 servers
        252: 18 IRC Operators online
        253: 44 unknown connection(s)
        254: 2548 channels formed
        255: I have 1854 clients and 1 servers
        265: Current local users: 1854  Max: 2147
        266: Current global users: 11010  Max: 11056
        250: Highest connection count: 2148 (2147 clients) (50146 connections received)

  - Titan pad:
    - Is the pre 2010 of google docs, google docs is far superior.
    - Barring google docs shutting down, or for lack of a better alternative,  there's no reason to use this for day to day work.

  - Alternative communication channels:
    - Smoke signals (pros: minimal technology stack)(cons:prehibts WAN comunication)
    - Email (pros: everyone has email)(cons: ?)
    - group me:(pros: easy to use)(cons: no code inlining, proprietary sass)
    - slack(pros: integrates with everything)(cons: proprietary sass)

# reflection:
Name: Shuttle Signups.
Website: https://github.com/wtg/shuttle-signups
Description: A web interface to simplify the process of signing up for special shuttles at RPI.
Project Goal: Before this project came to exist, a Google Form was used to facilitate sign-ups for these special shuttles. These forms weren't the best solution. This project aims to simplify that process, helping both students, and those at Auxiliary Services and Parking & Transportation.


Communication Modes (find all modes of communication i.e. IRC, website, etc.): Facebook messenger, Slack, Email, Github comments.

#styleguides:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EANG8ZZbRs
- The speaker advocates for styleguides to not be a manner of personal
expression but as a means to produce quality code across multiple development.
- In the case of javascript, he advocates for a lot of things which arent inherently necessary in the language (ie: defining functions before they are used, wrapping closures in additional parens)
