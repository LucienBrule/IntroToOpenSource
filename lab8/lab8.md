#Paragraph about what I did on the project in the last week:

In the last week I made a repository for the new project. Ran the express generator.
Documented the old carpool code. Fixed the dependancies for the old carpool code. 
Finally I discussed with my teammates how to best complete the project in the given timeframe.
We're going to keep much of the existing carpool code, document it further and refactor it. Then
we're going to port the names to a generalized schema, so it can be easily extended.
